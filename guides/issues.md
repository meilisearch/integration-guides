# Create Issues

Here are the process when opening issues for the integration repositories:
- If your issue concerns all the integration repositories or many of them (all the DevOps tools for example): open an issue in [integration-guides](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/issues/new).
- If your issue concerns a specific repository: open it directly in the concerned repository.
