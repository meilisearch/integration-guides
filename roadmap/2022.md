# Roadmap 2022

This is the roadmap planned by the Integration team at MeiliSearch for the year 2022.

Nothing is definitive: the roadmap can be adapted depending on the need of the users and the company.

## 2022: the Main Lines

Projects

- Release our first database integrations since we don't provide any in 2021.
- Provide complete and easy-to-maintain documentation for each SDK
